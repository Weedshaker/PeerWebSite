---- UI - Server ----
-1) update project and fix local server (https://github.com/muaz-khan/RTCMultiConnection-Server/blob/master/server.js)

0) fix that images keep the proper sizes when newly loaded

1) create new ui

2) save torrents (client.add(metadata, {"store": idb})) !!! metadata must be the App.Editor.WebTorrent.client.torrents[0].torrentFile -> torrent file (buffer) or parsed torrent (from parse-torrent https://github.com/webtorrent/parse-torrent)!!!, then it will resurrect the torrent from the indexeddb [https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/issues/1293#issuecomment-366378219, https://github.com/SilentBot1/webtorrent-examples/blob/master/resurrection/index.js]
    and content (save/load page in IndexedDB by page name or https://github.com/Stuk/jszip)

3) sever.js, socket.io, handshake node.js (reach user with simple geo-search and sub-domain by fingerprint pouchDB)
    > study events and make sure all events can be customized... and or replace  mueaz-khan-webrtc configs (MasterWebRTC this.connection.session), add more events to the api: like checking for participants total, onNewParticipant trigger function, information on connect, disconnect, etc.

 > DOM - make possible to temporarely indicate recently changed/updated parts of html -> domtree (move virtual dom stuff into its own class) https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom->Delayed properties
 > Webtorrent -> lazzy load when in viewport
 > Webtorrent -> seeder shall be able to choose if file gets appended as link or media
 > Let user choose to download file from certain size on (https://github.com/Flet/prettier-bytes (file.length))
 > When streaming, give user choice to download file, as soon as finished [show percentage] (client.torrents[0].files[0].getBlobURL((err, url) => {console.log(url)}))

 > solr (re)search
 > [3.1] as option keep page alive with torrent for static display (clients will start hosting the torrent as soon as the sender goes offline)
